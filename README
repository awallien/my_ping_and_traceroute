# Project 2: Build Your Own Ping and Traceroute

Two programs that simulate the 'ping' and 'traceroute' like the real ones in Linux.

## Requirements

This program is written in C and compiled using gcc version 9.3.0.
YOU MUST BE ROOT/ADMIN TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAMS, since opening raw sockets cannot be done
on standard user. 

## Compile

ping:
    gcc asw8675_ping.c -lm -o ping 

traceroute:
    gcc asw8675_traceroute.c -o traceroute


## Usage

ping:
    ./ping destination [-c count] [-i wait] [-s packetsize] [-t timeout]

traceroute:
    ./traceroute destination [-n numeric only] [-q nqueries] [-S]
